# Preface {-}

This textbook supplement is an introduction to causality in statistics and multivariable methods for students in their first college course in statistics.  Traditionally, except for a terse warning from instructors that "correlation does not imply causation", students only encounter causality in statistics if they take graduate-level courses in certain disciplines (economics, epidemiology, etc.).  However, given the ubiquity of data-driven arguments in modern society, a deeper understanding of drawing cause-and-effect conclusions from data is a core competency of college graduates and deserves attention in the liberal arts curriculum.  For more on causality in the undergraduate curriculum, see our paper [@cummiskey2020causal] and others on this subject [@horton2015challenges; @kaplan2018teaching; @lubke2020we].  

After introducing concepts in causality, we use an example-based approach to multiple regression emphasizing how the scientific goal of the study impacts modeling decisions and interpretation of results.  Prediction and cause-and-effect are the two main scientific goals of studies using multiple regression. These goals determine how researchers use and interpret models.  However, this distinction is rarely made in introductory courses.  Too often, multiple regression in the introductory course focuses on prediction and much of the "thinking" outsourced to algorithmic searches.  This narrow focus on prediction deprives students of the opportunity to exercise critical judgment and creativity.  On the other hand, cause-and-effect studies require tying subject matter knowledge to developing causal models.  During this process, students have to carefully consider relationships between variables (which is not particularly important in prediction), thus developing multivariable thinking, an important goal of the revised GAISE report [@carver2016guidelines].  Our approach to multiple regression uses the scientific goal to motivate how we think about our data and models.  @hernan2019second argue for this approach in data science education; we believe it is appropriate for introductory statistics courses also.        

This etext is appropriate for a wide variety of introductory statistics courses including both algrebra-based and calculus-based courses.  It assumes students understand basic concepts in data analysis, inference (confidence intervals and statistical tests for means and proportions), and simple linear regression.
