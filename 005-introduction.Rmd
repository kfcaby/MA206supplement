## Goals of quantitative research (describe, predict, cause-and-effect)

Researchers and practitioners in nearly every discipline employ quantitative methods to answer important questions and make decisions.  Regardless if it is finance, medicine, psychology, etc., all researchers typically have one of three goals [@cozby2020methods] when they conduct quantitative research:

* **describe**

* **predict** 

* **cause-and-effect**

(discuss external and internal validity here?)

For example, consider medical researchers investigating a newly discovered variant of the coronavirus.  Initially, they focus on describe studies.  *How prevalent is the variant in the population? How does the prevalence vary over space and time? What groups of individuals are most vulnerable to the variant? What else is associated with the variant?*   Together, these studies help the researchers better understand the variant and identify important variables for refined predict studies.  

Predict studies identify individuals most at risk for the variant or for transmitting it to others. Researchers select potential predictors as inputs to algorithms and statistical methods that transform them into estimates of each individual's risk for the variant.  These methods rely upon associations between the inputs and the variant.  In addition, these methods estimate the error associated with their predictions. Researchers try to ensure error estimates obtained within their study are good estimates of the error when their models are applied to other populations.  While predict studies help us identify who is at risk, they do not tell us the effect on their risk if we change something about them (quit smoking, lose weight, etc.)  To answer these "what if?" questions, researchers use cause-and-effect studies.

Cause-and-effect studies try to estimate the effect of intervening or changing some aspect of an individual.  These studies are tremendously important in public policy (where they are aptly called *intervention studies*) to justify expensive legislation and regulations to reduce risk.  Unlike prediction studies, which are highly algorithmic and only require researchers to identify appropriate inputs, cause-and-effect studies use subject matter knowledge of the causal structure of the inputs to select appropriate statistical models [@hernan2019second].  For example, to assess the affect of quitting smoking on coronavirus risk, we would have to understand why some people quit smoking and others do not, as these reasons themselves may be responsible for some of the reduction in risk we observe between the two groups. Also, unlike prediction studies which rely upon what we *see*, cause-and-effect studies require us to ask what would happen if we *do* something [@pearl2018book].  Only human beings are capable of such counterfactual thinking ("what would have happened if") - even our most sophisticated computer algorithms require human supervision to address cause-and-effect questions.

**Exercises**

1. For the following studies, identify the goal (describe, predict, cause-and-effect) of the study.  Briefly explain your choice:

* *A researcher obtains school records to collect information on the extracurricular activities of students.*

* *A researcher obtains school records to determine the impact of extracurricular activities on grades.*

* *A researcher obtains school records on extracurricular activities to identify students who are at risk to graduate.*

2.  Select an area of interest to you.  Write a sentence describing a study in your area of interest for each of the three goals (describe, predict, cause-and-effect)

## Validity

* internal validity

* external validity

In an area of research, there is often a natural tradeoff between internal and external validity.  Our knowledge comes from both observational studies and experiments (trials) -- rarely does a single study answer every question and the two types of studies used together can increase our overall knowledge. Consider researchers investigating the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.  Initial vaccine trials focus on internal validity to understand its effectiveness against the virus and obtain approval for mass distribution.  For example, @polack2020safety randomly assigned 43,548 persons 16 years of age or older to receive two doses of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer).  They observed eight cases of Covid-19 among participants who received BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those who received the placebo.  This was a huge moment in the pandemic! However, the subjects in the study were relatively heathly and had volunteered for the trials.  From this study alone, the external validity of these results is not clear and researchers want to know if the vaccine results would hold in the general public.  Given the success of the trials, it would be unethical to withhold the vaccine from large segements of the population, so observational studies are required.

@dagan2021bnt162b2 conducted an observational study after the mass vaccination campaign in Israel using the health records of 4.7 million patients enrolled in its largest integrated health care organization.  The researchers matched vaccine recipients and controls on important variables: age, sex, sector, neighborhood of residence, etc.. In this larger sample, they found vaccine effectiveness results consistent with the randomized trial, thus providing evidence of the vaccine's effectiveness in the general public.  The authors specifically address this point:  

> "Although randomized clinical trials [experiments] are considered the “gold standard” for evaluating intervention effects, they have notable limitations of sample size and subgroup analysis, restrictive inclusion criteria, and a highly controlled setting that may not be replicated in a mass vaccine rollout."
